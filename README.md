# Tara Glover - Senior Project Management & Product Development Leader

Hi! This page is intended to help you understand what it might be like to work with me.

Itâ€™s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of anyone on my team.

## Not Found On My Resume

I'm a mom of 5, and while that doesn't DEFINE me, parenting certainly informs my perspective. It also ensures I am learning something new every day and is a constant reminder to honor growth in whatever form it may take. 

I have lived in Maryland my whole life, but my calling is a remote fishing village in the Dominican Republic or some place like it.  

I bake my own bread, compost, and raise chickens and ducks (as pets and egg providers).  So far every animal born on our little homestead has been a boy so things get a little angsty each Spring. Check out my

## Communication

**Response time**: I will always do my best to provide immediate responses to emails or messages, even if only to acknowledge that the message had been received. Please don't ever hesitate to reach out for a coffee chat, brainstorming session, or anything else with me!

**Asynchronous communication**: I have a strong preference for asynchronous communication and will default to it when possible. While I recognize the importance of a well-defined meeting, I know that quality work comes from people working concurrently on projects and products at the times that work best for them. 

**Synchronous communication**: While I tend to default to async communication as a starting point, I also recognize the importance of synchronous communication in terms of building rapport, trust, and quickly delivering shared context to a group.

## My Values

I am incredibly passionate about diversity of all kinds, identity, accessibility and belonging. I value honesty, direct communication and authenticity.


## Working with Me

My goal is to clear obstacles, organize all the things, and build and streamline process. In general: to make your (work) life easier, clearer and less stressful. It cannot be overstated how much I value your knowledge and expertise and my desire to learn things from you.  

What's going on in your life doesn't stop just because you're at work. Please don't feel you can't talk about something because it's 'not work related'.
