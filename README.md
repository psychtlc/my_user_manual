# Tara Glover - Senior Web Project Manager
<summary>
    Hi! This page is intended to help you understand what it might be like to work with me.<br><br>

Itâ€™s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of anyoone on my team.

## Not Found On My Resume

<summary>
    I'm a mom of 5, and while that doesn't DEFINE me, parenting certainly takes a great deal of my time and mental energy. It also ensures I am learning something new every day and is a constant reminder to honor growth in whatever form it may take.  I am 'stepmom' to 2 of my kids and have been for 12 years.  Unfortunately/fortunately, I am somewhat of an expert on all things divorce, coparenting, and family-court-system related.
    <br><br>
    I have lived in Maryland my whole life, but my calling is a remote fishing village in the DR or some place like it.  
    <br><br>
    I bake my own bread, compost, and raise chickens and ducks (as pets and egg providers).  So far every animal born on our little homestead has been a boy so things get a little angsty each Spring.

## Communication

<summary>
    
    **Response time**: I will always do my best to provide immediate responses to emails or Slack messages, even if only to acknowledge that the message had been received. Please don't ever hesitate to reach out for a coffee chat, brainstorming session, or anything else with me via Zoom!

    **Asynchronous communication**: I have a strong preference for asynchronous communication and will default to it when possible. WHile I recognize the importance of a well-defined meeting, I know that quality work comes from people working concurrently on projects and products at the times that work best for them. 

    **Synchronous communication**: While I tend to default to async communication as a starting point, I also recognize the importance of synchronous communication in terms of building rapport, trust, and quickly delivering shared context to a group. 

     **My Availability**: You may find me around at 'odd' times, mainly due the nature of managing 3 kids at home in 3 different schools.  So while I might need to run to a midday doctor appointment or take some time to prep dinner, I will often catch up on things after the dishes are put away and everyones teeth are brushed.

</summary>

## Working with Me

 <summary>
    My goal is to clear obstacles, set context, and build process. In general: to make your (work) life easier, clearer and less stressful. It cannot be overstated how much I value your knowledge and expertise and my desire to learn things from you.  
    <br><br>
    What's going on in your life doesn't stop just because you're at work. Please don't feel you can't talk about something because it's 'not work related'.
